        <p>It's a Mexican restaurant, but I think the overall flavor is more American. It's a nice setting for a date, but it's not a value-for-money restaurant.</p>
      <div class="imgtext_1"><img class="image1" src="images/img_11.jpeg" alt="seafood rice" width="180px" height="180px"> <p>The Seafood Rice cooks with octoputs ink is the signature plate in Telerific Barcelona.</p> </div>

        <h1><a href="https://www.sushimaruyama.com/">Sushi Maruyama</a></h1>
        <p>Sushi Maruyama is the Japanese restaurant I chose to eat twice. The dining room is small in size. There is a small bar at the entrance. Guests can choose to sit at the bar and watch chefs make Sushi. The service at this restaurant is very good, they have the omakase for every day.</p>

        <div class="imgtext_4"><img class="image4" src="images/img_32.jpeg" alt="rice don" width="180px" height="180px"> <p>This rice don comes with grilled salmon, uni and salmon roe of the day we were there. The creamy texture is complemented by the fragrant rice. A day's satisfaction.</p> </div>

        <div class="imgtext_5"> <img  class="image5" src="images/img_31.jpeg" alt="sushi nigiri" width="180px" height="180px"> <p>The three kinds of Nigiri on the picture were the ones we ordered separately. Salmon was rich in fat, a satisfying bite. Sweet prawns were sweet and crisp. Tuna is good too, but SALMON is my favorite.</p>

        <div class="imgtext_8"> <img  class="image8" src="images/img_45.jpeg" alt="wagyu taco" width="180px" height="180px"> <p>Japanese Wagyu Taco, $4 each. Three in one order. We added one extra. It doesn't taste like a typical taco. It's juicy and has a truffle aroma on top. The wagyu melts in your mouth with Onions and sour sauce. I have to say it's worth $4.</p>
