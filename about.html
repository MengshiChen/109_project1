      <p><b>During the two years of the pandemic, I believe that many people, like me, have been blocked from exploring their plans. During this time, I kept looking through my photo albums and remembering the happiness of my previous trip because only in this way can bring a little comfort to my boring life.<br><br>
      The website was also created to spread and share happiness. When I started this project, I was emulating the form of magazines and playing cards. The magazine's cover and playing card as content. The goal is for each visitor to be able to browse through and relate to a familiar page. I placed some exploration and animation of the webpage. The purpose is to allow visitors to interact with the webpage, so as to achieve my purpose of sharing content.<br><br>
      I shared photos from my past travels and food exploring. To cater to my personal favorite vapor wave theme, I painted different backgrounds and selected some related colors. I want this page to be one that shares happiness and evokes good memories.</b>
